# MatthewsGalaxy2.0
🌐 A fullstack blog where I tell stories 🌐

• A personal website, a blog that resembles a social network

• Used .NET API for backend and Angular for frontend, PostgreSQL as a database system

• Created an email microservice that features a worker thread linked to an SMTP server that sends notifications on new blog posts to all users

• Used XUnit and Moq to test the main API as well as the email microservice

• Created a user registration and authentication mechanism based on JWT tokens, email verification for new users

• Used .NET Identity for user database schema and EF to create the other database entities

• Website features an admin panel, where administrators can create new posts or projects, or delete them

• Users can leave comments on articles, like them or share them, and also interact with other users' comments

• Each service is contained inside its docker image and the app can be deployed using a container orchestration tool
